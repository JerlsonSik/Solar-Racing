# Solar-Racing
I joined the solar racing team as a software developer to simulate the best solution for building a solar racing car. Our team has successfully won 2nd place in the Shell Eco-Marathon. 

## About Solar Racing Project:
This project is to simulate the power generated across each panel (with different angles) on the solar racing car to find out which cells grouping will be the best solution that could generate more power for the car. 
I created this project by using python, Google API and matplotlib

## Features of this project:
- User can interact with google maps by inputting their current address for calculation
- Calculation of solar insolation based on formula that are written in the code 
- Plot result by graph for viewing the best solution
