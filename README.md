# Solar-Racing
I joined the solar racing team as a software developer to simulate the best solution for building a solar racing car. Our team has successfully won 2nd place in the Shell Eco-Marathon. 

## About Solar Racing Project:
This project is to simulate the power generated across each panel (with different angles) on the solar racing car to find out which cells grouping will be the best solution that could generate more power for the car. 
I created this project by using python, Google API and matplotlib

## Features of this project:
- User can interact with google maps by inputting their current address for calculation
- Calculation of solar insolation based on formula that are written in the code 
- Plot result by graph for viewing the best solution

## What I learned:
- **Team working**: I worked with a big group of people (more than 50 in the team). By working on this project, I knew how to communicate effectively to finish up work.
- **Solving real-world problem**: At first, I was only told to find out what was the beset grouping solution for the solar cell. By then, I figured out the formula by looking into online resources and implemented all those calculations into the code.
- **Programming skills**: I used python as the main language to finish up the project. This is a great opportunity for me to enhance my python coding skills by implementing calculations, connecting to API and also by plotting graphs.
